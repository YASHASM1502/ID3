# Car Purchase Decision Tree (ID3 Algorithm from Scratch)

This project implements the **ID3 Decision Tree algorithm** from scratch in Python using a small, custom dataset related to **car purchase decisions**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

A synthetic dataset is used to determine whether a person is likely to buy a car based on:

- **Age Group**: Young, Middle, Senior
- **Income Level**: Low, Medium, High
- **Wants Luxury**: Yes, No
- **Credit Score**: Good, Poor
- **Target Variable**: Buys Car (Yes/No)

Example rows:
```

\['Young', 'High', 'Yes', 'Good', 'Yes']
\['Senior', 'Low', 'No', 'Poor', 'No']

```

## 🧠 Algorithm: ID3

ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is a classic algorithm to generate a **Decision Tree** using:

- **Entropy**: Measures impurity in a dataset.
- **Information Gain**: Measures the effectiveness of an attribute in classifying the data.

### How it works:
1. Calculate **entropy** of the current dataset.
2. For each attribute, calculate **information gain**.
3. Split the dataset on the attribute with the **highest information gain**.
4. Repeat recursively on each subset.

## ▶️ Running the Code

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Run the code:

```bash
python id3_car_purchase.py
````

---

## ✅ Output

Example output:

```python
{'Wants Luxury': {
    'Yes': {'Age Group': {
        'Young': {'Income': {
            'High': 'Yes',
            'Low': 'No',
            'Medium': 'Yes'}},
        'Middle': 'Yes',
        'Senior': 'Yes'}},
    'No': {'Credit Score': {
        'Good': 'Yes',
        'Poor': 'No'}}
}}
```

## 📌 Features

* No external libraries (only `math` and `collections`)
* Fully recursive implementation of ID3
* Easy to plug in custom categorical datasets
* Simple tree output for interpretation

---

## 📈 Possible Extensions

* Support for continuous (numerical) attributes
* Tree visualization with Graphviz
* Prediction on test samples
* Reading datasets from CSV using `pandas`
